# SplashScreenDemo

Most of the Android apps take some time to start up, especially on a cold start. There is a delay that you may not be able to avoid. Therefore, instead of giving just a blank screen during this time, why not show something nice to user?

By adding splash screen in Android, itâ€™s possible to showcase brand logo or a functionality till the app is configured. For this, you can refer our tutorial on [how to create splash screen in android app](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-splash-screen-android-example/) to showcase a functionality for few seconds.

If you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to Hire [Android App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
